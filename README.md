## Hi, I'm Josh Williams! :wave:. Welcome to my personal GitHub profile.

#### I do most of my work in [my orgs](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajwilliams-gh-green+OR+org%3Ajwilliams-gh-sandbox+OR+org%3Ajwilliams-gh-archived++&type=code) rather than directly tied to my profile. $${\color{red}Why}$$ :thinking:!? Because I prefer to manage my personal work like an enterprise. See each org below for more info.
